What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware or infrastructure, businesses and individuals can access these resources on-demand from cloud service providers. Cloud computing enables scalability, flexibility, cost-efficiency, and faster innovation.
